# CactusBot standards
These are the standards we follow here at CactusDev. We love getting features from the community, but we need code to be written in a certain manner in order for us to accept your help.

## Python Formatting
 We try to keep to a fairly straightforward method of operation, basically stick to PEP8 and you should be fine.

> ### Keep it clean
>   Big thing, we don't want any profanity or anything offensive in our code. We get it, coding can be frustrating and some people don't mind using strong language.
>
>   However, we try to maintain a professional image, and having random strong language and other possibly offensive stuff in our codebase doesn't look great.
>
> ### Tabs vs Spaces
>   PEP8 says that spaces are the preferred indentation method, so that's what our code is in.
>
>   We use a four (4) space indentation, so please make sure your code is formatted that way
>
> ### Maximum Line Length
>   PEP8 puts the maximum line length at 79 characters. Sometimes this can be a bit  too short to have nice looking code, so if you're a  few characters over and it  looks better than if it had been under, that's okay, we'll probably still  accept it.
>
>   However, if we're talking 10-20 characters or more over 79, then you're going  to have to find a way to get it under 79.
>
> ### Encoding
>   File encoding must be UTF-8. Shouldn't be too much of an issue, as most computers support it, but just as a precaution it's required.
>
> ### Quotes
>   PEP8 doesn't care about this, but we use double quotes, so please keep to that in your code.
>
> ### Basically everything else
>   Just follow PEP8 for your code formatting & you'll be fine :)
