## [Commands](commands.md)
Certain unique commands are included in every bot and are programmed with
more functionalities than a standard text response.

## [Targets](targets.md)
Targets are snippets of text, enclosed by `%`s, that are dynamically
replaced with corresponding values.

## [Contributing](contributing.md)
If you want to add some features, make sure to
follow these guidelines! It'll make things go a lot easier :)
