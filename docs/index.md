# Welcome to the CactusBot documentation!
This page contains information about syntax and usage techniques for CactusBot.

## [Commands](commands.md)
Certain unique commands are included in every bot and are programmed with
more functionalities than a standard text response.

## [Targets](targets.md)
Targets are snippets of text, enclosed by `%`s, that are dynamically
replaced with corresponding values.

## [Setup](setup.md)
If you plan on setting up your own instance of CB follow these instructions!

## [Standards](standards.md)
If you want to add some features or are hosting your own CactusBot, make sure to
follow these guidelines! It'll make things go a lot easier :)
